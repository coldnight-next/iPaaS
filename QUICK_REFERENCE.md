## 📊 Monitoring Queries

### Check Currency Conversions
```sql
SELECT 
  shopify_order_number,
  total_amount,
  currency,
  exchange_rate,
  converted_amount
FROM order_mappings
WHERE currency != base_currency
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Recent Refunds
```sql
SELECT 
  shopify_refund_id,
  refund_amount,
  sync_status,
  netsuite_credit_memo_id,
  error_message
FROM refund_mappings
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Refund Success Rate
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN sync_status = 'synced' THEN 1 END) as synced,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN sync_status = 'failed' THEN 1 END) as failed
FROM refund_mappings;
```

### Currency Cache Status
```sql
SELECT 
  from_currency,
  to_currency,
  rate,
  updated_at,
  NOW() - updated_at as age
FROM currency_rates
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

---

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Test Currency Conversion
```typescript
// In your code or SQL editor
const currencyService = new CurrencyService(supabase);
const rate = await currencyService.getExchangeRate('EUR', 'USD');
console.log(`1 EUR = ${rate} USD`);
```

### Manually Sync Refund
```sql
-- Find unprocessed refunds
SELECT * FROM refund_mappings 
WHERE sync_status = 'pending';

-- Mark for retry
UPDATE refund_mappings 
SET sync_status = 'pending' 
WHERE id = '<refund-id>';
```

### Clear Old Currency Cache
```sql
-- Delete rates older than 7 days
DELETE FROM currency_rates 
WHERE updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Currency conversion not working?
```sql
-- Check if API is being called
SELECT * FROM currency_rates ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- If empty, check edge function logs:
-- supabase functions logs shopify-webhook
```

### Refund not syncing?
```sql
-- Check webhook was received
SELECT * FROM webhook_events 
WHERE event_type = 'refunds/create' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check error message
SELECT error_message FROM refund_mappings 
WHERE sync_status = 'failed' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Webhook not firing?
1. Check Shopify webhook configuration
2. Verify URL: `https://<project>.supabase.co/functions/v1/shopify-webhook`
3. Test manually with curl (see deployment guide)

## 📈 Expected Results

### After Order Sync
- `order_mappings.currency` = Shopify currency (e.g., "EUR")
- `order_mappings.base_currency` = "USD"
- `order_mappings.exchange_rate` = current rate (e.g., 1.09)
- `order_mappings.converted_amount` = amount in USD

### After Refund
- `refund_mappings.sync_status` = "synced"
- `refund_mappings.netsuite_credit_memo_id` = NetSuite ID
- `webhook_events.processed` = true
- Credit memo visible in NetSuite

---

## ⚡ Performance

| Operation | Expected Time |
|-----------|--------------|
| Currency conversion (cached) | < 100ms |
| Currency conversion (API) | < 500ms |
| Refund webhook → Credit memo | 2-5 seconds |
| Order sync (with conversion) | +50ms overhead |
